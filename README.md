# Tic-Tac-Toe-in-Python
This is the first programm I ever wrote in Python. 
I just started programming and did my best to solve all the occuring problems with my limited knowledge

It should be obvious that this programm is supposed to be a simple commandline version of Tic-Tac-Toe.
The game itself is explained in the TicTacToe-code.py file

Enjoy!
